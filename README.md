SaaSquatch SDK for Java

## Adding SaaSquatch Java SDK to your project

SaaSquatch Java SDK is hosted on JitPack.

Add JitPack repository:

```xml
<repositories>
  <repository>
    <id>jitpack.io</id>
    <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
  </repository>
</repositories>
```

Add the dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.github.saasquatch</groupId>
  <artifactId>saasquatch-java-sdk</artifactId>
  <version>TODO</version>
</dependency>
```

For more information and other built tools, [please refer to the JitPack page](https://jitpack.io/#saasquatch/saasquatch-java-sdk).

This library aims to abstract away the I/O layer and [Reactive Streams](https://www.reactive-streams.org/) implementations to be implementation agnostic. As of right now, this library depends on [RxJava 3](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava), [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson), and [Apache HttpClient 5](https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-5.0.x/index.html), but never exposes library-specific interfaces other than Reactive Streams interfaces. **It is recommended that you explicitly import the transitive dependencies if you intend to use them**, since we may upgrade or switch to other I/O or Reactive Streams libraries in the future.

### Android

SaaSquatch Java SDK works on Java 8+ and Android API level 21+. To use this library on Android, you'll need to configure your project to use Java 8 by adding the following to `build.gradle` (see [Android official docs](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/java8-support) for more information).

## Using the SDK

The entry point of the SDK is `SaaSquatchClient`. To create a `SaaSquatchClient` for your tenant with default options, use:

```java
SaaSquatchClient.createForTenant("yourTenantAlias");
```

If you are in a multi-tenant environment, you can create a tenant-agnostic `SaaSquatchClient` like this:

```java
SaaSquatchClient.create(ClientOptions.newBuilder().build());
```

The code above will create a `SaaSquatchClient` without a default `tenantAlias`, in which case you'll need to pass in a `tenantAlias` via `RequestOptions` for every request you make.

You can also use more advanced options like this:

```java
SaaSquatchClient.create(ClientOptions.newBuilder()
    .setTenantAlias("yourTenantAlias")
    /*
     * This sets the default tenant API key. Note that this option makes more sense
     * if you are using this SDK on the server side. Use this with caution if you are
     * building an Android app.
     */
    .setAuthMethod(AuthMethod.ofApiKey("yourApiKey"))
    .setRequestTimeout(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
    // etc.
    .build());
```

It is recommended that you keep a singleton `SaaSquatchClient` for all your requests instead of creating a new `SaaSquatchClient` for every request. `SaaSquatchClient` implements `Closeable`, and it's a good idea to call `close()` to release resources when you are done with it.

Every API method in `SaaSquatchClient` takes a `RequestOptions`, where you can specify your `tenantAlias` override, authentication method override, etc. The per-method `RequestOptions` always takes precedence over the client-level `ClientOptions`.

`SaaSquatchClient` returns [Reactive Streams](https://www.reactive-streams.org/) interfaces. Assuming you are using RxJava, then a typical API call made with this SDK would look something like this:

```java
final Publisher<JsonObjectApiResponse> responsePublisher = saasquatchClient
    .userUpsert(userInput,
        RequestOptions.newBuilder().setAuthMethod(AuthMethods.ofJwt(jwt)).build());
Flowable.fromPublisher(responsePublisher)
    .doOnNext(response -> {
      System.out.printf("Status[%d] received\n", response.getHttpResponse().getStatusCode());
      // Getting the raw JSON data as a Map and do whatever you want with it
      final Map<String, Object> data = response.getData();
      // Or unmarshal the JSON result to one of the provided model classes
      final User user = response.toModel(User.class);
      System.out.printf("User with accountId[%s] and id[%s] created\n",
          user.getAccountId(), user.getId());
    })
    .onErrorResumeNext(ex -> {
      if (ex instanceof SaaSquatchApiException) {
        // Non 2XX received, in which case we should typically get a standard api error
        final ApiError apiError = ((SaaSquatchApiException) ex).getApiError();
        System.out.println(apiError.getMessage());
        return Flowable.empty();
      }
      // Catastrophic failure!!!
      ex.printStackTrace();
      return Flowable.error(ex);
    })
    .subscribe();
```

## Unstable APIs

Anything marked with the `@Beta` or `@Internal` annotations, as well as anything under the package `com.saasquatch.sdk.internal`, are either experimental or considered private API, and can be modified or removed without warning.

## Development

This project uses a simple Maven build. Compile wilth `mvn compile` and run tests with `mvn test`.

Since Android still doesn't fully support Java 8 ðŸ¤¦, Java 8 specific classes like `CompletableFuture`, `java.util.Optional`, and `java.time.Instant` should be avoided. Java 8 language features like lambda expressions, however, can be used. This restriction does not apply to the test suite.

To run integration tests, you'll need a SaaSquatch account, and run:

```bash
mvn test -D"com.saasquatch.sdk.test.appDomain"="REPLACEME" -D"com.saasquatch.sdk.test.tenantAlias"="REPLACEME" -D"com.saasquatch.sdk.test.tenantApiKey"="REPLACEME"
```
